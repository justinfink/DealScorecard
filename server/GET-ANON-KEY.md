# How to Get Your Supabase Anon Key

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/hujrpzqbyuyckewrkoap/settings/api

2. Under **Project API keys**, find the **anon/public** key

3. Copy the key (it starts with `eyJ...`)

4. Replace `YOUR_ANON_KEY_HERE` in `server/.env` with your actual anon key

Or you can tell me the anon key and I'll update the `.env` file for you!
